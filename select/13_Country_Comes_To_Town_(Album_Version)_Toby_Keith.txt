Well the weatherman said
It might storm today
I gotta hit the field
Gotta bale some hay
And I can't let it rain
On my daddy's farm
Till I get it all stacked
High in the barn
And I'm gonna call my baby
She's been waiting on me
She lives down town
On Sycamore Street
And the wheels on the black top
A startin' to whine
As I pass that Oklahoma City limit sign

I'm a hayseed
And a plow boy
I'm a farm kid
And a cowboy
I'm a roughneck
My daddy was a roughneck too
I run around with hillbilly girls
When the weekend sits
On my hillbilly world
You better get ready
When the sun goes down
That's when country comes to town

Daddy said child
You better let him be
Will I don't like him
And he don't like me
Momma just says
Ya'll have a little fun
Ain't doin' nothing
Me and papa ain't done
Open up the door to my pickup truck
And my baby jumps in
And fires it up
And she gives me a kiss
As I crawl in
We've been waiting all week for a weekend

I'm a hayseed
And a plow boy
I'm a farm kid
And a cowboy
I'm a roughneck
My daddy was a roughneck too
I run around with hillbilly girls
When the weekend sits
On my hillbilly world
You better be ready
When the sun goes down
That's when country comes to town

Yeah it's true
I run around wiht hillbilly girls
When the sits
On my hillbilly world
You better be ready
When the sun goes down
Cause that's when country comes to town
Here I come
